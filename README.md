# üöñ Cab Booking Application

Project Description:
This project is a cab booking application developed using React Native and Expo. It incorporates a machine learning-based surge price prediction system to accurately forecast prices within the application. The system utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, the application integrates the OpenRouteService API and Google Maps to provide users with efficient route planning and navigation. Firebase authentication and database functionalities are implemented to facilitate secure user login and registration. The app simplifies the cab booking process with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to book a cab in just five simple steps. With its robust features and reliable functionalities, this project offers a comprehensive solution for convenient and efficient cab booking.


## üì± Features

- **Book Cabs**: User-friendly interface for seamless cab booking.
- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Google Maps integration for precise location tracking and navigation.
- **Dynamic Fare Calculation**: Machine learning-based surge price prediction for accurate, real-time fare adjustments.
- **Weather Updates**: Fetches real-time weather information using API calls to help predict surge prices based on weather conditions.

## üöÄ Getting Started
---
To Create A Blank React-Native Project
1. sudo apt install nodejs npm
2. sudo npm install -g expo-cli
3. expo init <Folder Name> # Name of the app. For Example: cab_book. The project folder will be created in the current directory.
4. Select Blank
5. npm start

To set up a cloned React Native and Expo project, we need to install the necessary dependencies and development environment.
1. Install Node.js and npm: Download and install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), if it isn‚Äôt installed.
2. Install Expo CLI: Run the following command in your terminal to install the Expo CLI globally.
   npm install -g expo-cli
3. Clone the Project From GitHub: Open a terminal in the directory where you want to place the project and run:
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
4. Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the terminal to navigate into the cloned project folder:
   cd your-project-folder
5. Install Project Dependencies: Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file:
   npm install
   If you want to install dependencies one at a time: Run the following command:
   npm install <dependencies name>
   For Example: npm install axios
6. Now run the project:
   npm start.
