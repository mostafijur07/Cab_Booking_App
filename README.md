## üîç Surge Price Prediction Model
- This project includes a surge price prediction system built using a Random Forest Regressor in Python. The system predicts the surge multiplier for cab fares in Kolkata based on various factors such as date, time, location, distance, duration, and weather.

### Model Overview
The model leverages a Random Forest Regressor algorithm, known for handling nonlinear data. The model was trained on a dataset of over 1,000 rows of historical data. By analyzing the dataset‚Äôs features, the model predicts the surge multiplier, allowing users to understand how external factors affect pricing.

### Key Components of the Model
1. **Features and Target:**
  - Features (X): date, time, pickupLatitude, pickupLongitude, dropoffLatitude, dropoffLongitude, distance, duration, weatherCondition
  - Target (y): surgeMultiplier
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
  - One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
  - Train-Test Split (70% training, 30% testing).

### Dataset
The dataset contains detailed cab booking data for the city of Kolkata. It includes 1,000 rows, each representing an individual booking instance, and provides the following attributes:
1.**Date and Time:** Specifies when the booking was made.
2.**Pickup and Drop-off Locations:** Latitude and longitude coordinates for both the pickup and drop-off points.
3.**Distance and Duration:** Indicates the travel distance and estimated time for each trip.
4.**Weather Condition:** Captures the prevailing weather conditions at the time of booking.
5.**Surge Multiplier:** The target variable indicating the surge multiplier, which adjusts based on various factors such as time, location, and weather.
This dataset is utilized to train the machine learning model, enabling it to predict surge pricing accurately by analyzing patterns and correlations among these attributes.

### Model Training:
Random Forest with 100 decision trees.

### Model Evaluation:
**Metrics:**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.1328
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0255
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1598
- R¬≤ Score: 0.69

These results indicate reasonable accuracy, explaining 69% of the variance in surge pricing.

### üìä Data Visualization

Below are the visualizations generated from the dataset analysis:

   npm install -g expo-cli
3. Clone the Project From GitHub: Open a terminal in the directory where you want to place the project and run:
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
4. Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the terminal to navigate into the cloned project folder:
   cd your-project-folder
5. Install Project Dependencies: Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file:
   npm install
   If you want to install dependencies one at a time: Run the following command:
   npm install <dependencies name>
   For Example: npm install axios
6. Now run the project:
