üîç Surge Price Prediction Model
This project includes a surge price prediction system built using a Random Forest Regressor in Python. The system predicts the surge multiplier for cab fares in Kolkata based on various factors such as date, time, location, distance, duration, and weather.

Model Overview
The model leverages a Random Forest Regressor algorithm, known for handling nonlinear data. The model was trained on a dataset of over 1,000 rows of historical data. By analyzing the dataset‚Äôs features, the model predicts the surge multiplier, allowing users to understand how external factors affect pricing.

Key Components of the Model
Features and Target:

Features (X): date, time, pickupLatitude, pickupLongitude, dropoffLatitude, dropoffLongitude, distance, duration, weatherCondition
Target (y): surgeMultiplier
Data Preprocessing:

One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
Train-Test Split (70% training, 30% testing).
Model Training:

Random Forest with 100 decision trees.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.1328
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0255
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1598
R¬≤ Score: 0.69
These results indicate reasonable accuracy, explaining 69% of variance in surge pricing.

## üöÄ Getting Started
---
To Create A Blank React-Native Project
1. sudo apt install nodejs npm
2. sudo npm install -g expo-cli
3. expo init <Folder Name> # Name of the app. For Example: cab_book. The project folder will be created in the current directory.
4. Select Blank
5. npm start
   
---
To set up a cloned React Native and Expo project, we need to install the necessary dependencies and development environment.
1. Install Node.js and npm: Download and install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), if it isn‚Äôt installed.
2. Install Expo CLI: Run the following command in your terminal to install the Expo CLI globally.
   npm install -g expo-cli
3. Clone the Project From GitHub: Open a terminal in the directory where you want to place the project and run:
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
4. Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the terminal to navigate into the cloned project folder:
   cd your-project-folder
5. Install Project Dependencies: Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file:
   npm install
   If you want to install dependencies one at a time: Run the following command:
   npm install <dependencies name>
   For Example: npm install axios
6. Now run the project:
   npm start.
